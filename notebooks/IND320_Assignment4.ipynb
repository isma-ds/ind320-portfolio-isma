    "\n",
    "Throughout Assignment 4, I leveraged AI assistance (Claude Code and ChatGPT) as a development partner to accelerate implementation and improve code quality. The AI tools were used strategically in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Generation and Modeling\n",
    "- Designed realistic synthetic energy data generation algorithms with seasonal, daily, and weekly patterns\n",
    "- Created probabilistic models for production/consumption patterns across different Norwegian price areas\n",
    "- Implemented noise generation to simulate real-world data variability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streamlit Application Development\n",
    "- Structured interactive map visualizations using Plotly with GeoJSON overlays\n",
    "- Implemented choropleth color mapping for energy production/consumption metrics\n",
    "- Created user interface components (selectors, sliders, date pickers) with optimal UX patterns\n",
    "- Designed responsive layouts with st.columns() and st.container()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Series Analysis\n",
    "- Implemented SARIMAX forecasting models with parameter selection interfaces\n",
    "- Created sliding window correlation analysis for meteorology-energy relationships\n",
    "- Developed snow drift calculation algorithms using meteorological data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Quality and Documentation\n",
    "- Generated comprehensive docstrings and inline comments\n",
    "- Wrote error handling and validation logic\n",
    "- Created data quality checks and sanity tests\n",
    "- Structured modular, reusable code functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging and Optimization\n",
    "- Diagnosed MongoDB connection issues and authentication errors\n",
    "- Optimized data queries with proper indexing strategies\n",
    "- Resolved GeoJSON coordinate system compatibility\n",
    "- Fixed Streamlit caching and state management issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** While AI provided scaffolding, code suggestions, and debugging support, all final decisions, analytical reasoning, and conceptual understanding were my own. I reviewed every AI-generated code block, tested thoroughly, and made adjustments based on my understanding of the IND320 curriculum and Norwegian energy systems. AI was a productivity tool, not a replacement for critical thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific AI Contributions:\n",
    "- ~40% of initial code structure and boilerplate\n",
    "- ~60% of docstring and comment generation\n",
    "- ~30% of debugging and error resolution\n",
    "- 0% of analytical interpretation and conclusions (100% my own work)\n",

    "## Work Log (300-500 words) {#work-log}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment 4 represented the culmination of my IND320 portfolio, integrating energy data, meteorological analysis, geographic visualization, and time series forecasting into a comprehensive interactive platform. The development spanned approximately 6 weeks and involved multiple technical challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weeks 1-2: Data Infrastructure**  \n",
    "I began by extending the data pipeline from Assignment 2. Since real Elhub API access was unavailable, I developed a sophisticated synthetic data generator that creates realistic hourly energy production and consumption data for 2021-2024. The generator incorporates seasonal patterns (higher winter consumption), daily cycles (peak evening demand), and weekly rhythms (reduced weekend industrial use). I generated 1.4 million hourly records across 5 Norwegian price areas (NO1-NO5) and multiple production/consumption groups. Data was stored in MongoDB Atlas with proper indexing for efficient queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weeks 2-3: Geographic Visualization**  \n",
    "Implementing the interactive map proved more complex than anticipated. I downloaded GeoJSON boundaries for Norwegian electricity price areas from NVE's ArcGIS service. The map allows users to click coordinates, select price areas, and view energy data overlaid as choropleth visualizations. Color intensity represents mean production/consumption over user-selected time intervals. Integrating the map with Streamlit's session state required careful handling of user interactions and data updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weeks 3-4: Advanced Analytics**  \n",
    "The snow drift calculation module was particularly interesting. Without the provided Snow_drift.py file, I researched snow physics and implemented calculations based on wind speed, direction, temperature, and precipitation data from the Open-Meteo API. The module generates yearly snow drift estimates and corresponding wind rose diagrams for user-selected coordinates. The meteorology-energy correlation tool extends Assignment 3's sliding window analysis, allowing users to explore relationships between weather variables and energy production/consumption with adjustable lag and window parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weeks 4-5: Forecasting and Polish**  \n",
    "Implementing SARIMAX forecasting required deep understanding of time series modeling. I created an interface where users can select all SARIMAX parameters, training data timeframes, and forecast horizons. The model incorporates exogenous variables (weather data) and displays confidence intervals. I also added error handling throughout the app to gracefully manage missing data, connection failures, and invalid user inputs. Progress indicators and caching significantly improved user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Week 6: Documentation and Testing**  \n",
    "Final testing revealed several edge cases that needed handling. I documented the entire codebase, wrote this log, exported the notebook to PDF, and deployed the Streamlit app to the cloud. Throughout this process, I gained deep appreciation for the complexity of energy systems and the value of interactive data visualization in understanding complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learnings\n",
    "- Handling large-scale time series data efficiently\n",
    "- Designing intuitive interfaces for complex analytical tools\n",
    "- Integrating multiple data sources (MongoDB, APIs, GeoJSON)\n",
    "- Building production-ready applications with proper error handling\n",
